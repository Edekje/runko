Relativistic Vlasov 
===================

The relativistic Vlasov module uses the :ref:`fld` module for advancing the electromagnetic fields but, unlike the :ref:`pic` module, the 6D phase space is modeled by propagating a Vlasov fluid on a grid. The grid is split between the 3D spatial and 3V momentum dimensions.


.. warning::
  This module is experimental and is still work-in-progress. No extensive documentation exists and you are on your own.
