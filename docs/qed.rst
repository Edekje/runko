Quantum electrodynamics 
=======================

The radiation module implements various quantum electrodynamics (QED) processes where particles, electromagnetic fields, and radiation co-interact. The photons are modeled as Monte Carlo particles, similar to the plasma particles in the :ref:`pic` module.


.. warning::
  This module is experimental and is still work-in-progress. No extensive documentation exists and you are on your own.
