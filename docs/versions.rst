Versions
========

Runko uses ``major.minor`` code versioning scheme, i.e., ``1.0``, ``2.1`` etc. in its official releases.
Major versions typically introduce new features, major code refactoring, and other large changes. 
Minor versions contain smaller bug fixes and enchantments. 

See `GitHub Release History <https://github.com/natj/runko/releases>`_ for more details and a change log.


.. note::
    
    Tip of the GitHub master branch (.e., ``latest``) tracks the most recent development version of the code. To run a spesific version you have to downgrade the repository to that tag.
